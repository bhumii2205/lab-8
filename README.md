## ⚠️ Exception Handling

This project uses two custom exception classes to improve reliability and ensure clean error handling:

- **InvalidDataException**  
  Thrown when:
  - A student's marks are invalid (not in 0–100 range)
  - Any required input (like PRN or Name) is left empty

- **StudentNotFoundException**  
  Thrown when:
  - A student is searched by PRN or Name and is not found
  - An invalid position is accessed in the student list
  - A student is being updated or deleted but doesn't exist
